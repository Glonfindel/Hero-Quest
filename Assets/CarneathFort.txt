Carneath Fort
You slowly open your eyes and try to remember what happened before, but all you remember is pain and darkness. In front of you sits a girl with red braided hair and emerald eyes.
- It seems you’re finally awake. – she says. – Stand up. 

/next ( „What happened, where am I?” )

- You seem lost. – she laughs. – Don’t worry. Everyone loses their memory when they decide to join our ranks. There is only one family for us. My name is Raya. – she pauses for a second, then continues. – Go downstairs and meet Raknari, he will teach you all you need.

In front of you waits black man in leather armor. He holds short bow in his hands, and you see quiver full of arrows on his back.
- Welcome in Carneath, home to all Hunters around the world.  It is an honor to join us, but also a huge responsibility. Come, we should begin your training.

-Before you joined us, you were great warrior – says Raknari. – As your body is now back in shape i think you  should begin your journey. Remember. Our duty is to protect humanity not to kill every beast in sight.
