  descriptions:
  - Getting closer to the lake you see an old man full of wrinkles and white hair
    trying to push the boat on water - Hello, can i help you?- It seems you scared
    him. <cough> -Yes,   child. I would be really grateful if you could catch some
    fish for me.
  - After fishing for an hour you get so many fish, that old man will eat enough for
    some days.
  - -Thank you, child. There is not enough people willing to help an old man nowadays.
    Take this 10 gold as a thanks.
