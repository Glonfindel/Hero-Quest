  descriptions:
  - "You slowly open your eyes and try to remember what happened before, but all you
    remember is pain and darkness. In front of you sits a girl with red braided hair
    and emerald eyes. - It seems you\u2019re finally awake. \u2013 she says. \u2013
    Stand up. "
  - "- You seem lost. \u2013 she laughs. \u2013 Don\u2019t worry. Everyone loses their
    memory when they decide to join our ranks. There is only one family for us. My
    name is Raya. \u2013 she pauses for a second, then continues. \u2013 Go downstairs
    and meet Raknari, he will teach you all you need. "
  - 'In front of you waits black man in leather armor. He holds short bow in his hands,
    and you see quiver full of arrows on his back. - Welcome in Carneath, home to
    all Hunters around the world.  It is an honor to join us, but also a huge responsibility.
    Come, we should begin your training. '
  - "-Before you joined us, you were great warrior \u2013 says Raknari. \u2013 As
    your body is now back in shape i think you  should begin your journey. Remember.
    Our duty is to protect humanity not to kill every beast in sight. "
