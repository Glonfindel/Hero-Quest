Mystic Hills Farm
As you arrive in nearby farm, troubled peasant runs toward you.
- God bless you, Hunter. My name is Rick– he says. – Week ago my brother Tim, lumberjack went to cut down some trees in Yrst Woods. It’s not like him to stay away from home so long. I heard that harpies went more ferocious lately. Please, could you try to find him, and bring him back there if he’s still alive?
/next ( „I will” )

- Thank you. I will wait for your return and I hope Tim will be with you.
/next („Return when quest completed”)
- I see he is not with you… At least you tried. Thank you. – says Rick.
*You obtain 50 gold*
